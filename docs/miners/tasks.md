# Coding Tasks

### 1. Completion

The goal of this task is to complete the given code. You will be provided a functions name and must complete the function body.

The only protocol being sent is `query`, the expected response is the completed function body.


### 2. Debugging

This task is under development.

### 3. Fill-In-The-Middle (FIM)

The goal of this task is to fill in the middle of the given code. You will be provided a portion of code with a chunk missing. The chunk to be filled in is marked with "<fim_hole>". You should return the code to be placed in the filled in spot.

The only protocol being sent is `query`, the expected response is the code to be placed in the "<fim_hole>".


### 4. Organic Convo

This task is dynamic and will be at random sent using the input from the user using the frontend. You will be sent a conversation from the chat-frontend and are expected to return a good response.

You will be provided `messages` and potentially some `files`. You must return with an appropriate response given the messages and files.


### 5. Repo

In this task you will be sent a `query` containing a majority of the code from a file in a given repo, alongside that you will be given `files` containing the other files in the repo. Your goal is to use the files to complete the missing code in the query file.


### 6. Repo File 

In this task you will be given a `query` containing a summary of what a python file did, and `files` containing some other files that came from the same repo. You are to write the entire python file given the summary and files. 

### 7. SWE Task

In this task you are given a `query` of the style:

```
Given the following issue and files, please return a patch file that would fix the issue. An example of what you should return is
<patch> diff --git a/example.txt b/example.txt
index e69de29..d95f3ad 100644
--- a/example.txt
+++ b/example.txt
@@ -1,3 +1,3 @@
-Hello, world!
+Hello, universe!
 
 This is a simple text file.
-The end.
+Goodbye, world! </patch>
The following issue is:\n\n

<INSERT ISSUE HERE>
```

You must return a jsonified dictionary where the key is the filename and the value is the patch for that file. It does not have to be perfect as it will be parsed out and specific line numbers will be compared. 

The above prompt when fed into an LLM should be parsable and returnable immediately with the following code:

```python
def parse_diff(diff_string):
    lines = diff_string.splitlines()
    file_diffs = {}
    current_file = None
    diff_content = []
    is_diff_block = False

    for line in lines:
        if "diff --git" in line:
            if current_file and diff_content:
                file_diffs[current_file] = "\n".join(diff_content)
            current_file = line.split()[-1]
            diff_content = []
            is_diff_block = False
        elif line.startswith("---") or line.startswith("+++"):
            # Ignore these lines, as they indicate the old/new file path
            continue
        elif line.startswith("@@"):
            is_diff_block = True
            continue
        elif is_diff_block:
            diff_content.append(line)

    if current_file and diff_content:
        file_diffs[current_file] = "\n".join(diff_content)

    return file_diffs
```
